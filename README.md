## Recent works
#### ZAO Market

The ZAO Farmers app has been revamped and is now available on Playstore. I had an exciting journey working with an amazing team to create a seamless experience for farmers to connect with buyers directly. The app's advanced features allow farmers to display their products, set prices, and receive payments directly, which can help them generate more income and contribute to the growth of our agricultural sector.
