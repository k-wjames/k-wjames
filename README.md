- 👋 Hi, I’m Kariuki James, an android developer based in Nairobi Kenya.
- 👀 I’ve grown to habour alot of interest in Native Android development both with Java and Kotlin.
- 🌱 Always eager to learn new technologies and building up on skills already acquired, am ever on the lookout for new stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to contribute to some interesting open source projects as time goes by. Needless to say, I'd be very happy to be engaged in building your next android app. I won't mind whether freelance, remote or onsite gigs.
